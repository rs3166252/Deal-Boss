Deal Boss (Terms of Service & Privacy Policy)

# Privacy Policy
- Effective Date: [03:58 PM 26-Jan-2025 IST]
- Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how Deals Boss collects, uses, and protects your data.

### Data We Collect

- Server Information: Server ID, Channel ID (where deals are posted), and the number of members in the server.
- Logs: Failure logs (e.g., server name, reason for failure) to troubleshoot issues and improve the bot’s functionality.
### Data We Do Not Collect

- Deals Boss does not collect user data, personal messages, or any other sensitive information.
### How We Use Your Data

- Server and channel information is used solely to deliver deals to the designated channel.
- Failure logs are reviewed only to identify and fix technical issues.
### Data Sharing

- Deals Boss does not share collected data with third parties. However, affiliate links redirect users to Amazon, and Amazon's privacy practices apply beyond this point.
### Data Security

- All collected data is stored securely and is only accessible to the developer for troubleshooting and maintenance.
### User Control

- Server administrators can remove the bot at any time, which will stop all data collection for that server.
### Third-Party Services

- Deals Boss uses Amazon-affiliated links. Please refer to Amazon’s Privacy Policy for details on how they handle user data.
### Contact

- If you have questions about this policy or your data, contact the developer at [cstriekrdj+Dealboss@gmail.com or Discord Link: https://discord.gg/uBmUGuWWgT].
